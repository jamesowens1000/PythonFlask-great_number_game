# Assignment: Great Number Game
Objectives:

• Practice using session to store data about a client's history with the web app

• Practice clearing a session

• Practice having the server use data submitted by a client with a form


I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100...

Create a site that allows a user to play this guessing game. Upon loading, the server should "pick" a random number between 1-100; store the number in session. Allow the user to guess the number--tell them when they are too high or too low. If they guess the correct number, notify them and offer to play again.
